# SQL Project: Consumer Goods - Ad-hoc Insights

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a multi-million-row database in the consumer goods domain using SQL. The objective was to respond to 10 ad-hoc business data requests by writing optimized queries that extract meaningful insights. The queries make extensive use of advanced SQL features including joins, window functions, CTEs, and stored procedures to solve realistic business problems.

## Learnings:

- Used aggregate functions such as `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `SUM` in combination with `GROUP BY`
- Practiced different types of joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`, and `CROSS JOIN`
- Built queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better readability and modular design
- Created and used stored procedures, views, and temporary tables for reusability and performance
- Applied window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` for ranking and analysis
- Improved ability to translate business requirements into efficient SQL queries
